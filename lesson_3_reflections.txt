When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   
   When you want to share your files to a community.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because these could be experimental changes that you don't want to update the 
    local repository with.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

    Forks allow you to clone repositories from GitHub to GitHub.
    
    Clones allow you to take an existing repository and make one just like it either locally
    or remotely.

    Branches happen on a single repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

     Provides you an updated version of the GitHub remote locally on your computer.
