When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   
   When you want to share your files to a community.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because these could be experimental changes that you don't want to update the 
    local repository with.
